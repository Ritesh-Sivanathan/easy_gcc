iterating thru args of argv gives the input value in the same format

each one is a char so 1 byte and the pointer is 8 bytes (something new I learnt about the sizeof function)
Link to the reference for that: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26619914/why-is-char-str-anything-always-the-size-of-8

thinking process:

taking the args and inputting them into the string should be simple since the input to the run command looks like this:

run {fileName} {everything else}

only issue I see is having too many flags to the point where it exceeds the preallocated max input size

maybe there's a way for me to dynamically allocate it/expand it if needed otherwise keep it at a minimum
first let me deal with the main goal; add the ability for arguments
